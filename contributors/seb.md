In the foggy plains of northern Italy, Sebastiano has worked at a smartwatch startup before moving his curls to London on to do great things. Regularly speaking at conferences and brain-dumping on the ‘net got him into the Google Developer Experts programme in 2014. Nowadays he’s obsessing over UI and UX and coding some rather cool apps at [Novoda](http://novoda.com).
