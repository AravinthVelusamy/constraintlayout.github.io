# Contributing

In the near future we aim to allow community contributions to this site via pull request. However time has not permitted us to write the guidelines for how to contribute, yet

Until we have guidelines in place, we will not be accepting pull requests on this repo. We'll update this page once we have contribution guidelines written.
